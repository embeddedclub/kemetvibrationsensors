# Introduction
When you clap with hands we can hear a sound, it can be turn into music based on the variation , vibration and velocity.  Its clearly says

instruments are not really required to make any music. I remember those days where i used to make some sounds on our school desk/table.

Today i have the vibration sensor which outputs can be used to produce some actual instrumental music with Apple's GarageBand.
